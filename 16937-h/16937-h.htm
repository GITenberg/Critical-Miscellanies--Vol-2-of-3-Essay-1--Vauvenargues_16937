<h2><a name="VAUVENARGUES" id="VAUVENARGUES"></a>VAUVENARGUES.</h2>


<p>One of the most important phases of French thought<a name="Page_1" id="Page_1"></a>
in the great century of its illumination is only
thoroughly intelligible, on condition that in studying
it we keep constantly in mind the eloquence, force,
and genius of Pascal. He was the greatest and most
influential representative of that way of viewing
human nature and its circumstances, which it was
one of the characteristic glories of the eighteenth
century to have rebelled against and rejected. More
than a hundred years after the publication of the
<i>Pens&eacute;es</i>, Condorcet thought it worth while to prepare
a new edition of them, with annotations, protesting,
not without a certain unwonted deference of tone,
against Pascal's doctrine of the base and desperate
estate of man. Voltaire also had them reprinted
with notes of his own, written in the same spirit of
vivacious deprecation, which we may be sure would
have been even more vivacious, if Voltaire had not
remembered that he was speaking of the mightiest
of all the enemies of the Jesuits. Apart from formal
and specific dissents like these, all the writers who
had drunk most deeply of the spirit of the eighteenth
century, lived in a constant ferment of revolt against<a name="Page_2" id="Page_2"></a>
the clear-witted and vigorous thinker of the century
before, who had clothed mere theological mysteries
with the force and importance of strongly entrenched
propositions in a consistent philosophy.</p>

<p>The resplendent fervour of Bossuet's declamations
upon the nothingness of kings, the pitifulness of
mortal aims, the crushing ever-ready grip of the hand
of God upon the purpose and faculty of man, rather
filled the mind with exaltation than really depressed
or humiliated it. From Bossuet to Pascal is to pass
from the solemn splendour of the church to the chill
of the crypt. Besides, Bossuet's attitude was professional,
in the first place, and it was purely theological,
in the second; so the main stream of thought flowed
away and aside from him. To Pascal it was felt
necessary that there should be reply and vindication,
whether in the shape of deliberate and published
formulas, or in the reasoned convictions of the
individual intelligence working privately. A syllabus
of the radical articles of the French creed of the
eighteenth century would consist largely of the
contradictions of the main propositions of Pascal.
The old theological idea of the fall was hard to
endure, but the idea of the fall was clenched by such
general laws of human nature as this,&mdash;that 'men
are so necessarily mad, that it would be to be mad
by a new form of madness not to be mad;'&mdash;that
man is nothing but masquerading, lying, and hypocrisy,
both in what concerns himself and in respect of
others, wishing not to have the truth told to himself,<a name="Page_3" id="Page_3"></a>
and shrinking from telling it to anybody else;<a name="FNanchor_1_1" id="FNanchor_1_1"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_1" class="fnanchor">[1]</a> that
the will, the imagination, the disorders of the body,
the thousand concealed infirmities of the intelligence,
conspire to reduce our discovery of justice and truth
to a process of haphazard, in which we more often
miss the mark than hit.<a name="FNanchor_2_2" id="FNanchor_2_2"></a><a href="#Footnote_2_2" class="fnanchor">[2]</a> Pleasure, ambition, industry,
are only means of distracting men from the otherwise
unavoidable contemplation of their own misery. How
speak of the dignity of the race and its history, when
we know that a grain of sand in Cromwell's bladder
altered the destinies of a kingdom, and that if
Cleopatra's nose had been shorter the whole surface
of the earth would be different? Imagine, in a word,
'a number of men in chains, and all condemned to
death; some of them each day butchered in the sight
of the others, while those who remain watch their
own condition in that of their fellows, and eyeing
one another in anguish and hopelessness, wait their
turn; such is the situation of man.'<a name="FNanchor_3_3" id="FNanchor_3_3"></a><a href="#Footnote_3_3" class="fnanchor">[3]</a></p>

<p>It was hardly possible to push the tragical side of
the verities of life beyond this, and there was soon
an instinctive reaction towards realities. The sensations
with their conditions of pleasure no less than of
pain; the intelligence with its energetic aptitudes for
the discovery of protective and fruitful knowledge;
the affections with their large capacities for giving
and receiving delight; the spontaneous inner impulse
towards action and endurance in the face of outward<a name="Page_4" id="Page_4"></a>
circumstances&mdash;all these things reassured men, and
restored in theory to them with ample interest what
in practice they had never lost&mdash;a rational faith and
exultation in their own faculties, both of finding out
truth and of feeling a very substantial degree of
happiness. On this side too, as on the other,
speculation went to its extreme limit. The hapless
and despairing wretches of Pascal were transformed
by the votaries of perfectibility into bright beings
not any lower than the angels. Between the two
extremes there was one fine moralist who knew how
to hold a just balance, perceiving that language is
the expression of relations and proportions, that when
we speak of virtue and genius we mean qualities that
compared with those of mediocre souls deserve these
high names, that greatness and happiness are comparative
terms, and that there is nothing to be said
of the estate of man except relatively. This moralist
was Vauvenargues.</p>

<p>Vauvenargues was born of a good Proven&ccedil;al stock
at Aix, in the year 1715. He had scarcely any of
that kind of education which is usually performed in
school-classes, and he was never able to read either
Latin or Greek. Such slight knowledge as he ever
got of the famous writers among the ancients was in
translations. Of English literature, though its influence
and that of our institutions were then becoming
paramount in France, and though he had a particular
esteem for the English character, he knew only the
writings of Locke and Pope, and the Paradise Lost.<a name="FNanchor_4_4" id="FNanchor_4_4"></a><a href="#Footnote_4_4" class="fnanchor">[4]</a>
Vauvenargues must be added to the list of thinkers<a name="Page_5" id="Page_5"></a>
and writers whose personal history shows, what men
of letters sometimes appear to be in a conspiracy to
make us forget, that for sober, healthy, and robust
judgment on human nature and life, active and
sympathetic contact with men in the transaction of
the many affairs of their daily life is a better
preparation than any amount of wholly meditative
seclusion. He is also one of the many who show
that a weakly constitution of body is not incompatible
with fine and energetic qualities of mind, even if it
be not actually friendly to them. Nor was feeble
health any disqualification for the profession of arms.
As Arms and the Church were the only alternatives
for persons of noble birth, Vauvenargues, choosing
the former, became a subaltern in the King's Own
Regiment at the age of twenty (1735). Here in time
he saw active service; for in 1740 the death of
Charles VI. threw all Europe into confusion, and the
French Government, falling in with the prodigious
designs of the Marshal Belle-Isle and his brother,
took sides against Maria Theresa, and supported the
claims of the unhappy Elector of Bavaria who afterwards
became the Emperor Charles VII. The disasters
which fell upon France in consequence are well
known. The forces despatched to Bavaria and
Bohemia, after the brief triumph of the capture of
Prague, were gradually overwhelmed without a single<a name="Page_6" id="Page_6"></a>
great battle, and it was considered a signal piece of
good fortune when in the winter of 1742-43 Belle-Isle
succeeded, with a loss of half his force, in leading by
a long circuit, in the view of the enemy, and amid
the horrors of famine and intense frost, some thirteen
thousand men away from Prague. The King's
Regiment took part in the Bohemian campaign, and
in this frightful march which closed it; Vauvenargues
with the rest.</p>

<p>To physical sufferings during two winters was
added the distress of losing a comrade to whom he
was deeply attached; he perished in the spring of
'42 under the hardships of the war. The <i>&Eacute;loge</i> in
which Vauvenargues commemorates the virtues and
the pitiful fate of his friend, is too deeply marked
with the florid and declamatory style of youth to be
pleasing to a more ripened taste.<a name="FNanchor_5_5" id="FNanchor_5_5"></a><a href="#Footnote_5_5" class="fnanchor">[5]</a> He complained
that nobody who had read it observed that it was
touching, not remembering that even the most tender
feeling fails to touch us, when it has found stilted
and turgid expression. Delicacy and warmth of
affection were prominent characteristics in Vauvenargues.
Perhaps if his life had been passed in less
severe circumstances, this fine susceptibility might
have become fanciful and morbid. As it was, he
loved his friends with a certain patient sweetness and
equanimity, in which there was never the faintest
tinge of fretfulness, caprice, exacting vanity, or any
of those other vices which betray in men that<a name="Page_7" id="Page_7"></a>
excessive consciousness of their own personality,
which lies at the root of most of the obstacles in the
way of an even and humane life. His nature had
such depth and quality that the perpetual untowardness
of circumstances left no evil print upon him;
hardship made him not sour, but patient and wise,
and there is no surer sign of noble temper.</p>

<p>The sufferings and bereavements of war were not
his only trials. Vauvenargues was beset throughout
the whole of his short life with the sordid and
humiliating embarrassments of narrow means. His
letters to Saint-Vincens, the most intimate of his
friends, disclose the straits to which he was driven.
The nature of these straits is an old story all over
the world, and Vauvenargues did the same things
that young men in want of money have generally
done. It cannot be said, I fear, that he passed along
those miry ways without some defilement. He
bethinks him on one occasion that a rich neighbour
has daughters. 'Why should I not undertake to
marry one of them within two years, with a reasonable
dowry, if he would lend me the money I want and
provided I should not have repaid it by the time
fixed?'<a name="FNanchor_6_6" id="FNanchor_6_6"></a><a href="#Footnote_6_6" class="fnanchor">[6]</a> We must make allowance for the youth of
the writer, and for a different view of marriage and
its significance from our own. Even then there
remains something to regret. Poverty, wrote Vauvenargues,
in a maxim smacking unwontedly of
commonplace, cannot debase strong souls, any more<a name="Page_8" id="Page_8"></a>
than riches can elevate low souls.<a name="FNanchor_7_7" id="FNanchor_7_7"></a><a href="#Footnote_7_7" class="fnanchor">[7]</a> That depends.
If poverty means pinching and fretting need of
money, it may not debase the soul in any vital sense,
but it is extremely likely to wear away a very
priceless kind of delicacy in a man's estimate of
human relations and their import.</p>

<p>Vauvenargues has told us what he found the life
of the camp. Luxurious and indolent living, neglected
duties, discontented sighing after the delights of
Paris, the exaltation of rank and mediocrity, an
insolent contempt for merit; these were the characteristics
of the men in high military place. The
lower officers meantime were overwhelmed by an
expenditure that the luxury of their superiors
introduced and encouraged; and they were speedily
driven to retire by the disorder of their affairs, or by
the impossibility of promotion, because men of spirit
could not long endure the sight of flagrant injustice,
and because those who labour for fame cannot tie
themselves to a condition where there is nothing to
be gathered but shame and humiliation.<a name="FNanchor_8_8" id="FNanchor_8_8"></a><a href="#Footnote_8_8" class="fnanchor">[8]</a></p>

<p>To these considerations of an extravagant expenditure
and the absence of every chance of promotion,
there was added in the case of Vauvenargues the still
more powerful drawback of irretrievably broken
health. The winter-march from Prague to Egra had
sown fatal seed. His legs had been frost-bitten, and
before they could be cured he was stricken by
small-pox, which left him disfigured and almost blind.<a name="Page_9" id="Page_9"></a>
So after a service of nine years, he quitted military
life (1744). He vainly solicited employment as a
diplomatist. The career was not yet open to the
talents, and in the memorial which Vauvenargues
drew up he dwelt less on his conduct than on his
birth, being careful to show that he had an authentic
ancestor who was Governor of Hy&egrave;res in the early
part of the fourteenth century.<a name="FNanchor_9_9" id="FNanchor_9_9"></a><a href="#Footnote_9_9" class="fnanchor">[9]</a> But the only road
to employment lay through the Court. The claims
even of birth counted for nothing, unless they were
backed by favour among the ignoble creatures who
haunted Versailles. For success it was essential to
be not only high-born, but a parasite as well. 'Permit
me to assure you, sir,' Vauvenargues wrote courageously
to Amelot, then the minister, 'that it is this
moral impossibility for a gentleman, with only zeal to
commend him, of ever reaching the King his master,
which causes the discouragement that is observed
among the nobility of the provinces, and which
extinguishes all ambition.'<a name="FNanchor_10_10" id="FNanchor_10_10"></a><a href="#Footnote_10_10" class="fnanchor">[10]</a> Amelot, to oblige Voltaire,
eager as usual in good offices for his friend,
answered the letters which Vauvenargues wrote, and
promised to lay his name before the King as soon as
a favourable opportunity should present itself.<a name="FNanchor_11_11" id="FNanchor_11_11"></a><a href="#Footnote_11_11" class="fnanchor">[11]</a></p>

<p>Vauvenargues was probably enough of a man of
the world to take fair words of this sort at their
value, and he had enough of qualities that do not
belong to the man of the world to enable him to
confront the disappointment with cheerful fortitude<a name="Page_10" id="Page_10"></a>
'Misfortune itself,' he had once written, 'has its
charms in great extremities; for this opposition of
fortune raises a courageous mind, and makes it collect
all the forces that before were unemployed: it is in
indolence and littleness that virtue suffers, when a
timid prudence prevents it from rising in flight and
forces it to creep along in bonds.'<a name="FNanchor_12_12" id="FNanchor_12_12"></a><a href="#Footnote_12_12" class="fnanchor">[12]</a> He was true to
the counsel which he had thus given years before,
and with the consciousness that death was rapidly
approaching, and that all hope of advancement in
the ordinary way was at an end, even if there were
any chance of his life, he persevered in his project of
going to Paris, there to earn the fame which he
instinctively felt that he had it in him to achieve.
Neither scantiness of means nor the vehement
protests of friends and relations&mdash;always the worst
foes to superior character on critical occasions&mdash;could
detain him in the obscurity of Provence. In 1745
he took up his quarters in Paris in a humble house
near the School of Medicine. Literature had not yet
acquired that importance in France which it was so
soon to obtain. The Encyclop&aelig;dia was still unconceived,
and the momentous work which that famous
design was to accomplish, of organising the philosophers
and men of letters into an army with banners,
was still unexecuted. Voltaire, indeed, had risen, if
not to the full height of his reputation, yet high
enough both to command the admiration of people of
quality, and to be the recognised chief of the new<a name="Page_11" id="Page_11"></a>
school of literature and thought. Voltaire had been
struck by a letter in which Vauvenargues, then
unknown to him, had sent a criticism comparing
Corneille disadvantageously with Racine. Coming
from a young officer, the member of a profession
which Voltaire frankly described as 'very noble, in
truth, but slightly barbarous,' this criticism was
peculiarly striking. A great many years afterwards
Voltaire was surprised in the same way, to find that
an officer could write such a book as the <i>F&eacute;licit&eacute;
Publique</i> of the Marquis de Chastellux. To Vauvenargues
he replied with many compliments, and pointed
out with a good deal of pains the injustice which the
young critic had done to the great author of <i>Cinna</i>.
'<i>It is the part of a man like you</i>,' he said admirably,
'<i>to have preferences, but no exclusions.</i>'<a name="FNanchor_13_13" id="FNanchor_13_13"></a><a href="#Footnote_13_13" class="fnanchor">[13]</a> The correspondence
thus begun was kept up with ever-growing
warmth and mutual respect. 'If you had been born
a few years earlier,' Voltaire wrote to him, 'my
works would be worth all the more for it; but at
any rate, even at the close of my career, you confirm
me in the path that you pursue.'<a name="FNanchor_14_14" id="FNanchor_14_14"></a><a href="#Footnote_14_14" class="fnanchor">[14]</a></p>

<p>The personal impression was as fascinating as that
which had been conveyed by Vauvenargues' letters.
Voltaire took every opportunity of visiting his
unfortunate friend, then each day drawing nearer
to the grave. Men of humbler stature were equally
attracted. 'It was at this time,' says the light-hearted
Marmontel, 'that I first saw at home the man who<a name="Page_12" id="Page_12"></a>
had a charm for me beyond all the rest of the world,
the good, the virtuous, the wise Vauvenargues.
Cruelly used by nature in his body, he was in soul
one of her rarest masterpieces. I seemed to see in
him F&eacute;nelon weak and suffering. I could make a
good book of his conversations, if I had had a chance
of collecting them. You see some traces of it in the
selection that he has left of his thoughts and
meditations. But all eloquent and full of feeling as
he is in his writings, he was even more so still in his
conversation.'<a name="FNanchor_15_15" id="FNanchor_15_15"></a><a href="#Footnote_15_15" class="fnanchor">[15]</a> Marmontel felt sincere grief when
Vauvenargues died, and in the <i>Epistle to Voltaire</i>
expressed his sorrow in some fair lines. They
contain the happy phrase applied to Vauvenargues,
'<i>ce c&#339;ur sto&iuml;que et tendre</i>.'<a name="FNanchor_16_16" id="FNanchor_16_16"></a><a href="#Footnote_16_16" class="fnanchor">[16]</a></p>

<p>In religious sentiment Vauvenargues was out of
the groove of his time. That is to say, he was not
unsusceptible of religion. Accepting no dogma, so
far as we can judge, and complying with no observances,
very faint and doubtful as to even the fundamentals&mdash;God,
immortality, and the like&mdash;he never
partook of the furious and bitter antipathy of the
best men of that century against the church, its
creeds, and its book. At one time, as will be seen
from a passage which will be quoted by and by, his
leanings were towards that vague and indefinable<a name="Page_13" id="Page_13"></a>
doctrine which identifies God with all the forces and
their manifestations in the universe. Afterwards even
this adumbration of a theistic explanation of the
world seems to have passed from him, and he lived,
as many other not bad men have lived, with that fair
working substitute for a religious doctrine which is
provided in the tranquil search, or the acceptance in
a devotional spirit, of all larger mortal experiences
and higher human impressions. There is a <i>Meditation
on the Faith</i>, including a <i>Prayer</i>, among his writings;
and there can be little doubt, in spite of Condorcet's
incredible account of the circumstances of its composition,
that it is the expression of what was at the time
a sincere feeling.<a name="FNanchor_17_17" id="FNanchor_17_17"></a><a href="#Footnote_17_17" class="fnanchor">[17]</a> It is, however, rather the straining
and ecstatic rhapsody of one who ardently seeks
faith, than the calm and devout assurance of him who
already possesses it. Vauvenargues was religious by
temperament, but he could not entirely resist the
intellectual influences of the period. The one fact
delivered him from dogma and superstition, and the
other from scoffing and harsh unspirituality. He saw
that apart from the question of the truth or falsehood
of its historic basis, there was a balance to be struck
between the consolations and the afflictions of the
faith.<a name="FNanchor_18_18" id="FNanchor_18_18"></a><a href="#Footnote_18_18" class="fnanchor">[18]</a> Practically he was content to leave this
balance unstruck, and to pass by on the other side.
Scarcely any of his maxims concern religion. One of
these few is worth quoting, where he says: 'The
strength or weakness of our belief depends more on<a name="Page_14" id="Page_14"></a>
our courage than our light; not all those who mock
at auguries have more intellect than those who believe

<p>The end came in the spring of 1747, when Vauvenargues
was no more than thirty-two. Perhaps, in
spite of his physical miseries, these two years in Paris
were the least unhappy time in his life. He was in
the great centre where the fame which he longed for
was earned and liberally awarded. A year of intercourse
with so full and alert and brilliant a mind as
Voltaire's, must have been more to one so appreciative
of mental greatness as Vauvenargues, than many years
of intercourse with subalterns in the Regiment of the
King. With death, now known to be very near at
hand, he had made his account before. 'To execute
great things,' he had written in a maxim which gained
the lively praise of Voltaire, 'a man must live as
though he had never to die.'<a name="FNanchor_20_20" id="FNanchor_20_20"></a><a href="#Footnote_20_20" class="fnanchor">[20]</a> This mood was
common among the Greeks and Romans; but the
religion which Europe accepted in the time of its
deepest corruption and depravation, retained the
mark of its dismal origin nowhere so strongly as in
the distorted prominence which it gave in the minds
of its votaries to the dissolution of the body. It was<a name="Page_15" id="Page_15"></a>
one of the first conditions of the Revival of Reason
that the dreary <i>memento mori</i> and its hateful emblems
should be deliberately effaced. 'The thought of
death,' said Vauvenargues, 'leads us astray, because
it makes us forget to live.' He did not understand
living in the sense which the dissolute attach to it.
The libertinism of his regiment called no severe
rebuke from him, but his meditative temper drew him
away from it even in his youth. It is not impossible
that if his days had not been cut short, he might
have impressed Parisian society with ideas and a
sentiment, that would have left to it all its cheerfulness,
and yet prevented that laxity which so fatally
weakened it. Turgot, the only other conspicuous
man who could have withstood the license of the
time, had probably too much of that austerity which
is in the fibre of so many great characters, to make
any moral counsels that he might have given widely
effective.</p>

<p>Vauvenargues was sufficiently free from all taint
of the pedagogue or the preacher to have dispelled
the sophisms of licence, less by argument than by the
gracious attraction of virtue in his own character.
The stock moralist, like the commonplace orator of
the pulpit, fails to touch the hearts of men or to
affect their lives, for lack of delicacy, of sympathy,
and of freshness; he attempts to compensate for this
by excess of emphasis, and that more often disgusts
us than persuades. Vauvenargues, on the other
hand, is remarkable for delicacy and half-reserved<a name="Page_16" id="Page_16"></a>
tenderness. Everything that he has said is coloured
and warmed with feeling for the infirmities of men.
He writes not merely as an analytical outsider.
Hence, unlike most moralists, he is no satirist. He
had borne the burdens. 'The looker-on,' runs one of
his maxims, 'softly lying in a carpeted chamber,
inveighs against the soldier, who passes winter nights
on the river's edge, and keeps watch in silence over
the safety of the land.'<a name="FNanchor_21_21" id="FNanchor_21_21"></a><a href="#Footnote_21_21" class="fnanchor">[21]</a> Vauvenargues had been
something very different from the safe and sheltered
critic of other men's battles, and this is the secret of
the hold which his words have upon us. They are
real, with the reality that can only come from two
sources; from high poetic imagination, which Vauvenargues
did not possess, or else from experience of life
acting on and strengthening a generous nature. 'The
cause of most books of morality being so insipid,' he
says, 'is that their authors are not sincere; is that,
being feeble echoes of one another, they could not
venture to publish their own real maxims and private
sentiments.'<a name="FNanchor_22_22" id="FNanchor_22_22"></a><a href="#Footnote_22_22" class="fnanchor">[22]</a> One of the secrets of his own freedom
from this ordinary insipidity of moralists was his
freedom also from their pretentiousness and insincerity.</p>

<p>Besides these positive merits, he had, as we have
said, the negative distinction of never being emphatic.
His sayings are nearly always moderate and persuasive,
alike in sentiment and in phrase. Sometimes
they are almost tentative in the diffidence of their turn.<a name="Page_17" id="Page_17"></a>
Compared with him La Rochefoucauld's manner is
hard, and that of La Bruy&egrave;re sententious. In the
moralist who aspires to move and win men by their
best side instead of their worst, the absence of this
hardness and the presence of a certain lambency and
play even in the exposition of truths of perfect assurance,
are essential conditions of psychagogic quality.
In religion such law does not hold, and the contagion
of fanaticism is usually most rapidly spread by a
rigorous and cheerless example.</p>

<p>We may notice in passing that Vauvenargues has
the defects of his qualities, and that with his aversion
to emphasis was bound up a certain inability to appreciate
even grandeur and originality, if they were too
strongly and boldly marked. 'It is easy to criticise
an author,' he has said, 'but hard to estimate him.'<a name="FNanchor_23_23" id="FNanchor_23_23"></a><a href="#Footnote_23_23" class="fnanchor">[23]</a>
This was never more unfortunately proved than in
the remarks of Vauvenargues himself upon the great
Moli&egrave;re. There is almost a difficulty in forgiving a
writer who can say that 'La Bruy&egrave;re, animated with
nearly the same genius, painted the crookedness of
men with as much truth and as much force as Moli&egrave;re;
but I believe that there is more eloquence and more
elevation to be found in La Bruy&egrave;re's images.'<a name="FNanchor_24_24" id="FNanchor_24_24"></a><a href="#Footnote_24_24" class="fnanchor">[24]</a> Without
at all undervaluing La Bruy&egrave;re, one of the acutest
and finest of writers, we may say that this is a truly
disastrous piece of criticism. Quite as unhappy is the
preference given to Racine over Moli&egrave;re, not merely
for the conclusion arrived at, but for the reasons on<a name="Page_18" id="Page_18"></a>
which it is founded. Moli&egrave;re's subjects, we read, are
low, his language negligent and incorrect, his characters
bizarre and eccentric. Racine, on the other
hand, takes sublime themes, presents us with noble
types, and writes with simplicity and elegance. It
is not enough to concede to Racine the glory of art,
while giving to Moli&egrave;re or Corneille the glory of genius.
'When people speak of the art of Racine&mdash;the art
which puts things in their place; which characterises
men, their passions, manners, genius; which banishes
obscurities, superfluities, false brilliancies; which
paints nature with fire, sublimity, and grace&mdash;what
can we think of such art as this, except that it is the
genius of extraordinary men, and the origin of those
rules that writers without genius embrace with so
much zeal and so little success?'<a name="FNanchor_25_25" id="FNanchor_25_25"></a><a href="#Footnote_25_25" class="fnanchor">[25]</a> And it is certainly
true that the art of Racine implied genius. The
defect of the criticism lies, as usual, in a failure to see
that there is glory enough in both; in the art of
highly-finished composition and presentation, and in
the art of bold and striking creation. Yet Vauvenargues
was able to discern the secret of the popularity
of Moli&egrave;re, and the foundation of the common opinion
that no other dramatist had carried his own kind of
art so far as Moli&egrave;re had carried his; 'the reason is,
I fancy, that he is more natural than any of the
others, and this is an important lesson for everybody
who wishes to write.'<a name="FNanchor_26_26" id="FNanchor_26_26"></a><a href="#Footnote_26_26" class="fnanchor">[26]</a> He did not see how nearly
everything went in this concession, that Moli&egrave;re was,<a name="Page_19" id="Page_19"></a>
above all, natural. With equal truth of perception
he condemned the affectation of grandeur lent by the
French tragedians to classical personages who were
in truth simple and natural, as the principal defect
of the national drama, and the common rock on which
their poets made shipwreck.<a name="FNanchor_27_27" id="FNanchor_27_27"></a><a href="#Footnote_27_27" class="fnanchor">[27]</a> Let us, however,
rejoice for the sake of the critical reputation of
Vauvenargues that he was unable to read Shakespeare.
One for whom Moli&egrave;re is too eccentric,
grotesque, inelegant, was not likely to do much
justice to the mightiest but most irregular of all
dramatists.</p>

<p>A man's prepossessions in dramatic poetry, supposing
him to be cultivated enough to have any prepossessions,
furnish the most certain clue that we can
get to the spirit in which he inwardly regards character
and conduct. The uniform and reasoned preference
which Vauvenargues had for Racine over
Moli&egrave;re and Corneille, was only the transfer to art of
that balanced, moderate, normal, and emphatically
harmonious temper, which he brought to the survey
of human nature. Excess was a condition of thought,
feeling, and speech, that in every form was disagreeable
to him; alike in the gloom of Pascal's reveries,
and in the inflation of speech of some of the heroes
of Corneille. He failed to relish even Montaigne as
he ought to have done, because Montaigne's method
was too prolix, his scepticism too universal, his egoism
too manifest, and because he did not produce complete<a name="Page_20" id="Page_20"></a>
and artistic wholes.<a name="FNanchor_28_28" id="FNanchor_28_28"></a><a href="#Footnote_28_28" class="fnanchor">[28]</a></p>

<p>Reasonableness is the strongest mark in Vauvenargues'
thinking; balance, evenness, purity of vision,
penetration finely toned with indulgence. He is never
betrayed into criticism of men from the point of view
of immutable first principles. Perhaps this was what
the elder Mirabeau meant when he wrote to Vauvenargues,
who was his cousin: 'You have the English
genius to perfection,' and what Vauvenargues meant
when he wrote of himself to Mirabeau: 'Nobody in
the world has a mind less French than I.'<a name="FNanchor_29_29" id="FNanchor_29_29"></a><a href="#Footnote_29_29" class="fnanchor">[29]</a> These
international comparisons are among the least fruitful
of literary amusements, even when they happen
not to be extremely misleading; as when, for example,
Voltaire called Locke the English Pascal, a description
which can only be true on condition that the
qualifying adjective is meant to strip either Locke or
Pascal of most of his characteristic traits. And if we
compare Vauvenargues with any of our English aphoristic
writers, there is not resemblance enough to
make the contrast instructive. The obvious truth is
that in this department our literature is particularly
weak, while French literature is particularly strong in
it. With the exception of Bacon, we have no writer
of apophthegms of the first order; and the difference
between Bacon as a moralist and Pascal or Vauvenargues,
is the difference between Polonius's famous
discourse to Laertes and the soliloquy of Hamlet.</p>

<p>Bacon's precepts refer rather to external conduct and<a name="Page_21" id="Page_21"></a>
worldly fortune than to the inner composition of character,
or to the 'wide, gray, lampless' depths of
human destiny. We find the same national characteristic,
though on an infinitely lower level, in Franklin's
oracular saws. Among the French sages a psychological
element is predominant, as well as an occasional
transcendent loftiness of feeling, not to be found
in Bacon's wisest maxims, and from his point of view
in their composition we could not expect to find
them there. We seek in vain amid the positivity of
Bacon, or the quaint and timorous paradox of Browne,
or the acute sobriety of Shaftesbury, for any of that
poetic pensiveness which is strong in Vauvenargues,
and reaches tragic heights in Pascal.<a name="FNanchor_30_30" id="FNanchor_30_30"></a><a href="#Footnote_30_30" class="fnanchor">[30]</a>Addison may
have the delicacy of Vauvenargues, but it is a delicacy
that wants the stir and warmth of feeling. It seems
as if with English writers poetic sentiment naturally
sought expression in poetic forms, while the Frenchmen
of nearly corresponding temperament were restrained
within the limits of prose by reason of the
vigorously prescribed stateliness and stiffness of their
verse at that time. A man in this country with the
quality of Vauvenargues, with his delicacy, tenderness,
elevation, would have composed lyrics. We
have undoubtedly lost much by the laxity and irregularity<a name="Page_22" id="Page_22"></a>
of our verse, but as undoubtedly we owe to
its freedom some of the most perfect and delightful
of the minor figures that adorn the noble gallery of
English poets.</p>

<p>It would be an error to explain the superiority of
the great French moralists by supposing in them a
fancy and imagination too defective for poetic art. It
was the circumstances of the national literature during
the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries which made
Vauvenargues for instance a composer of aphorisms,
rather than a moral poet like Pope. Let us remember
some of his own most discriminating words. 'Who
has more imagination,' he asks, 'than Bossuet, Montaigne,
Descartes, Pascal, all of them great philosophers?
Who more judgment and wisdom than Racine, Boileau,
La Fontaine, Moli&egrave;re, all of them poets full of genius?
<i>It is not true, then, that the ruling qualities exclude the
others; on the contrary, they suppose them.</i> I should be
much surprised if a great poet were without vivid
lights on philosophy, at any rate moral philosophy, and
it will very seldom happen for a true philosopher to
be totally devoid of imagination.'<a name="FNanchor_31_31" id="FNanchor_31_31"></a><a href="#Footnote_31_31" class="fnanchor">[31]</a> With imagination
in the highest sense Vauvenargues was not largely
endowed, but he had as much as is essential to reveal
to one that the hard and sober-judging faculty is not
the single, nor even the main element, in a wise and
full intelligence. 'All my philosophy,' he wrote to
Mirabeau, when only four or five and twenty years
old, an age when the intellect is usually most exigent<a name="Page_23" id="Page_23"></a>
of supremacy, 'all my philosophy has its source in my
heart.'<a name="FNanchor_32_32" id="FNanchor_32_32"></a><a href="#Footnote_32_32" class="fnanchor">[32]</a></p>

<p>In the same spirit he had well said that there is
more cleverness in the world than greatness of soul,
more people with talent than with lofty character.<a name="FNanchor_33_33" id="FNanchor_33_33"></a><a href="#Footnote_33_33" class="fnanchor">[33]</a>
Hence some of the most peculiarly characteristic and
impressive of his aphorisms; that famous one, for
instance, '<i>Great thoughts come from the heart,</i>' and the
rest which hang upon the same idea. 'Virtuous
instinct has no need of reason, but supplies it.'
'Reason misleads us more often than nature.' 'Reason
does not know the interests of the heart.' 'Perhaps
we owe to the passions the greatest advantages of the
intellect.' Such sayings are only true on condition
that instinct and nature and passion have been already
moulded under the influence of reason; just as this
other saying, which won the warm admiration of
Voltaire, '<i>Magnanimity owes no account of its motives to
prudence</i>,' is only true on condition that by magnanimity
we understand a mood not out of accord with
the loftiest kind of prudence.<a name="FNanchor_34_34" id="FNanchor_34_34"></a><a href="#Footnote_34_34" class="fnanchor">[34]</a> But in the eighteenth
century reason and prudence were words current in
their lower and narrower sense, and thus one coming<a name="Page_24" id="Page_24"></a>
like Vauvenargues to see this lowness and narrowness,
sought to invest ideas and terms that in fact only
involved modifications of these, with a significance of
direct antagonism. Magnanimity was contrasted
inimically with prudence, and instinct and nature
were made to thrust from their throne reason and
reflection. Carried to its limit, this tendency developed
the speculative and social excesses of the
great sentimental school. In Vauvenargues it was
only the moderate, just, and most seasonable protest
of a fine observer, against the supremacy among ideals
of a narrow, deliberative, and calculating spirit.</p>

<p>His exaltation of virtuous instinct over reason is
in a curious way parallel to Burke's memorable exaltation
over reason of prejudice. 'Prejudice,' said
Burke, 'previously engages the mind in a steady
course of wisdom and virtue, and does not leave the
man hesitating in the moment of decision, sceptical,
puzzled, and unresolved. Prejudice renders a man's
virtue his habit, and not a series of unconnected acts;
through just prejudice his duty becomes a part of
his nature.'<a name="FNanchor_35_35" id="FNanchor_35_35"></a><a href="#Footnote_35_35" class="fnanchor">[35]</a> What Burke designated as prejudice,
Vauvenargues less philosophically styled virtuous instinct;
each meant precisely the same thing, though
the difference of phrase implied a different view of its
origin and growth: and the side opposite to each of
them was the same&mdash;namely, a sophisticated and
over-refining intelligence, narrowed to the consideration
of particular circumstances as they presented<a name="Page_25" id="Page_25"></a>
themselves.</p>

<p>Translated into the modern equivalent, the heart,
nature, instinct of Vauvenargues all mean <i>character</i>.
He insisted upon spontaneous impulse as a condition
of all greatest thought and action. Men think and
work on the highest level when they move without
conscious and deliberate strain after virtue: when, in
other words, their habitual motives, aims, methods,
their character, in short, naturally draw them into
the region of what is virtuous. '<i>It is by our ideas
that we ennoble our passions or we debase them; they
rise high or sink low according to the man's soul</i>.'<a name="FNanchor_36_36" id="FNanchor_36_36"></a><a href="#Footnote_36_36" class="fnanchor">[36]</a> All
this has ceased to be new to our generation, but a
hundred and thirty years ago, and indeed much nearer
to us than that, the key to all nobleness was thought
to be found only by cool balancing and prudential
calculation. A book like <i>Clarissa Harlowe</i> shows us
this prudential and calculating temper underneath a
varnish of sentimentalism and fine feelings, an incongruous
and extremely displeasing combination, particularly
characteristic of certain sets and circles in
that century. One of the distinctions of Vauvenargues
is that exaltation of sentiment did not with
him cloak a substantial adherence to a low prudence,
nor to that fragment of reason which has so constantly
usurped the name and place of the whole. He
eschewed the too common compromise which the
sentimentalist makes with reflection and calculation,
and it was this which saved him from being a sentimentalist.</p>

<p>That doctrine of the predominance of the heart<a name="Page_26" id="Page_26"></a>
over the head, which has brought forth so many pernicious
and destructive fantasies in the history of
social thought, represented in his case no more than a
reaction against the great detractors of humanity.
Rochefoucauld had surveyed mankind exclusively
from the point of their vain and egoistic propensities,
and his aphorisms are profoundly true of all persons
in whom these propensities are habitually supreme,
and of all the world in so far as these propensities
happen to influence them. Pascal, on the one hand,
leaving the affections and inclinations of a man very
much on one side, had directed all his efforts to showing
the pitiful feebleness and incurable helplessness
of man in the sphere of the understanding. Vauvenargues
is thus confronted by two sinister pictures of
humanity&mdash;the one of its moral meanness and littleness,
the other of its intellectual poverty and impotency.
He turned away from both of them, and found
in magnanimous and unsophisticated feeling, of which
he was conscious in himself and observant in others,
a compensation alike for the selfishness of some men
and the intellectual limitations of all men. This
compensation was ample enough to restore the human
self-respect that Pascal and Rochefoucauld had done
their best to weaken.</p>

<p>The truth in that disparagement was indisputable
so far as it went. It was not a kind of truth, however,
on which it is good for the world much to dwell,<a name="Page_27" id="Page_27"></a>
and it is the thinkers like Vauvenargues who build
up and inspire high resolve. 'Scarcely any maxim,'
runs one of his own, 'is true in all respects.'<a name="FNanchor_37_37" id="FNanchor_37_37"></a><a href="#Footnote_37_37" class="fnanchor">[37]</a> We
must take them in pairs to find out the mean truth;
and to understand the ways of men, so far as words
about men can help us, we must read with appreciation
not only Vauvenargues, who said that great thoughts
come from the heart, but La Rochefoucauld, who
called the intelligence the dupe of the heart, and
Pascal, who saw only desperate creatures, miserably
perishing before one another's eyes in the grim dungeon
of the universe. Yet it is the observer in the spirit
of Vauvenargues, of whom we must always say that
he has chosen the better part. Vauvenargues' own
estimate was sound. 'The Duke of La Rochefoucauld
seized to perfection the weak side of human nature;
maybe he knew its strength too; and only contested
the merit of so many splendid actions in order to
unmask false wisdom. Whatever his design, the
effect seems to me mischievous; his book, filled with
delicate invective against hypocrisy, even to this day
turns men away from virtue, by persuading them that
it is never genuine.'<a name="FNanchor_38_38" id="FNanchor_38_38"></a><a href="#Footnote_38_38" class="fnanchor">[38]</a> Or, as he put it elsewhere,
without express personal reference: 'You must arouse
in men the feeling of their prudence and strength, if
you would raise their character; those who only apply
themselves to bring out the absurdities and weaknesses
of mankind, enlighten the judgment of the public far
less than they deprave its inclination.'<a name="FNanchor_39_39" id="FNanchor_39_39"></a><a href="#Footnote_39_39" class="fnanchor">[39]</a> This principle<a name="Page_28" id="Page_28"></a>
was implied in Goethe's excellent saying, that if
you would improve a man, it is best to begin by persuading
him that he is already that which you would
have him to be.</p>

<p>To talk in this way was to bring men out from
the pits which cynicism on the one side, and asceticism
on the other, had dug so deep for them, back to the
warm precincts of the cheerful day. The cynic and
the ascetic had each looked at life through a microscope,
exaggerating blemishes, distorting proportions,
filling the eye with ugly and disgusting illusions.<a name="FNanchor_40_40" id="FNanchor_40_40"></a><a href="#Footnote_40_40" class="fnanchor">[40]</a>
Humanity, as was said, was in disgrace with the
thinkers. The maxims of Vauvenargues were a plea
for a return to a healthy and normal sense of relations.
'These philosophers,' he cried, 'are men, yet
they do not speak in human language; they change
all the ideas of things, and misuse all their terms.'<a name="FNanchor_41_41" id="FNanchor_41_41"></a><a href="#Footnote_41_41" class="fnanchor">[41]</a>
These are some of the most direct of his retorts upon
Pascal and La Rochefoucauld:</p>

<p>'I have always felt it to be absurd for philosophers
to fabricate a Virtue that is incompatible with the
nature of humanity, and then after having pretended
this, to declare coldly that there is no virtue. If they<a name="Page_29" id="Page_29"></a>
are speaking of the phantom of their imagination,
they may of course abandon or destroy it as they
please, for they invented it; but true virtue&mdash;which
they cannot be brought to call by this name, because
it is not in conformity with their definitions; which
is the work of nature and not their own; and which
consists mainly in goodness and vigour of soul&mdash;that
does not depend on their fancies, and will last
for ever with characters that cannot possibly be
effaced.'</p>

<p>'The body has its graces, the intellect its talents;
is the heart then to have nothing but vices? And
must man, who is capable of reason, be incapable of
virtue?'</p>

<p>'We are susceptible of friendship, justice, humanity,
compassion, and reason. O my friends, what then is
virtue?'</p>

<p>'Disgust is no mark of health, nor is appetite a
disorder; quite the reverse. Thus we think of the
body, but we judge the soul on other principles. We
suppose that a strong soul is one that is exempt from
passions, and as youth is more active and ardent than
later age, we look on it as a time of fever, and place
the strength of man in his decay.'<a name="FNanchor_42_42" id="FNanchor_42_42"></a><a href="#Footnote_42_42" class="fnanchor">[42]</a></p>

<hr style='width: 45%;' />

<p>The theological speculator insists that virtue lies
in a constant and fierce struggle between the will
and the passions, between man and human nature.</p>

<p>Vauvenargues founded his whole theory of life on the<a name="Page_30" id="Page_30"></a>
doctrine that the will is not something independent
of passions, inclinations, and ideas, but on the contrary
is a mere index moved and fixed by them, as
the hand of a clock follows the operation of the
mechanical forces within. Character is an integral
unit. 'Whether it is reason or passion that moves
us, it is we who determine ourselves; it would be
madness to distinguish one's thoughts and sentiments
from one's self.... No will in men, which does not
owe its direction to their temperament, their reasoning,
and their actual feelings.'<a name="FNanchor_43_43" id="FNanchor_43_43"></a><a href="#Footnote_43_43" class="fnanchor">[43]</a> Virtue, then, is not
necessarily a condition of strife between the will and
the rest of our faculties and passions; no such strife
is possible, for the will obeys the preponderant passion
or idea, or group of passions and ideas; and the contest
lies between one passion or group and another.
Hence, in right character there is no struggle at all,
for the virtuous inclinations naturally and easily
direct our will and actions; virtue is then independent
of struggle; and the circumstance of our finding
pleasure in this or that practice, is no reason why
both the practice and the pleasure should not be
unimpeachably virtuous.</p>

<p>It is easy to see the connection between this theory
of the dependence of the will, and the prominence
which Vauvenargues is ever giving to the passions.
These are the key to the movements of the will. To
direct and shape the latter, you must educate the
former. It was for his perception of this truth, we<a name="Page_31" id="Page_31"></a>
may notice in passing, that Comte awarded to Vauvenargues
a place in the Positivist Calendar; 'for his
direct effort, in spite of the universal desuetude into
which it had fallen, to reorganise the culture of the
heart according to a better knowledge of human
nature, of which this noble thinker discerned the
centre to be affective.'<a name="FNanchor_44_44" id="FNanchor_44_44"></a><a href="#Footnote_44_44" class="fnanchor">[44]</a></p>

<p>This theory of the will, however, was not allowed
to rest here; the activity of man was connected with
the universal order. 'What prevents the mind from
perceiving the motive of its actions, is only their
infinite quickness. Our thoughts perish at the moment
in which their effects make themselves known; when
the action commences, the principle has vanished;
the will appears, the feeling is gone; we cannot find
it ourselves, and so doubt if we ever had it. But it
would be an enormous defect to have a will without
a principle; our actions would be all haphazard; the
world would be nothing but caprice; all order would
be overturned. It is not enough, then, to admit it
to be true that it is reflection or sentiment that leads
us: we must add further that it would be monstrous
for this to be otherwise.<a name="FNanchor_45_45" id="FNanchor_45_45"></a><a href="#Footnote_45_45" class="fnanchor">[45]</a> ...</p>

<p>'The will recalls or suspends our ideas; our ideas
shape or vary the laws of the will; the laws of the will
are thus dependent on the laws of creation; but the laws
of creation are not foreign to ourselves, they constitute
our being, and form our essence, and are entirely
our own, and we can say boldly that we act by ourselves,<a name="Page_32" id="Page_32"></a>
when we only act by them.<a name="FNanchor_46_46" id="FNanchor_46_46"></a><a href="#Footnote_46_46" class="fnanchor">[46]</a> ...</p>

<p>'Let us recognise here, then, our profound subjection....
Let us rend the melancholy veil which
hides from our eyes the eternal chain of the world
and the glory of the Creator.... External objects
form ideas in the mind, these ideas form sentiments,
these sentiments volitions, these volitions actions in
ourselves and outside of ourselves. So noble a
dependence in all the parts of this vast universe must
conduct our reflections to the unity of its principle;
this subordination makes the true greatness of the
beings subordinated. The excellence of man is in his
dependence; his subjection displays two marvellous
images&mdash;the infinite power of God, and the dignity
of our own soul.... Man independent would be an
object of contempt; the feeling of his own imperfection
would be his eternal torture. But the same feeling,
when we admit his dependence, is the foundation
of his sweetest hope; it reveals to him the nothingness
of finite good, and leads him back to his principle,
which insists on joining itself to him, and which alone
can satisfy his desires in the possession of himself.'<a name="FNanchor_47_47" id="FNanchor_47_47"></a><a href="#Footnote_47_47" class="fnanchor">[47]</a></p>

<p>Vauvenargues showed his genuine healthiness not
more by a plenary rejection of the doctrine of the
incurable vileness and frenzy of man, than by his
freedom from the boisterous and stupid transcendental
optimism which has too many votaries in our time.
He would not have men told that they are miserable
earth-gnomes, the slaves of a black destiny, but he<a name="Page_33" id="Page_33"></a>
still placed them a good deal lower than the angels.
For instance: 'We are too inattentive or too much
occupied with ourselves, to get to the bottom of one
another's characters; <i>whoever has watched masks at a
ball dancing together in a friendly manner, and joining
hands without knowing who the others are, and then parting
the moment afterwards never to meet again nor ever
to regret, or be regretted, can form some idea of the world</i>.'<a name="FNanchor_48_48" id="FNanchor_48_48"></a><a href="#Footnote_48_48" class="fnanchor">[48]</a>
But then, as he said elsewhere: 'We can be perfectly
aware of our imperfection, without being humiliated
by the sight. <i>One of the noblest qualities of our nature
is that we are able so easily to dispense with greater perfection.</i>'<a name="FNanchor_49_49" id="FNanchor_49_49"></a><a href="#Footnote_49_49" class="fnanchor">[49]</a>
In all this we mark the large and rational
humaneness of the new time, a tolerant and kindly
and elevating estimate of men.</p>

<p>The faith in the natural and simple operation of
virtue, without the aid of all sorts of valetudinarian
restrictions, comes out on every occasion. The
Trappist theory of the conditions of virtue found no
quarter with him. Mirabeau for instance complained
of the atmosphere of the Court, as fatal to the practice
of virtue. Vauvenargues replied that the people there
were doubtless no better than they should be, and
that vice was dominant. 'So much the worse for
those who have vices. But when you are fortunate
enough to possess virtue, it is, to my thinking, a very
noble ambition to lift up this same virtue in the
bosom of corruption, to make it succeed, to place it
above all, to indulge and control the passions without<a name="Page_34" id="Page_34"></a>
reproach, to overthrow the obstacles to them, and to
surrender yourself to the inclinations of an upright
and magnanimous heart, instead of combating or
concealing them in retreat, without either satisfying
or vanquishing them. I know nothing so weak and
so vain as to flee before vices, or to hate them without
measure; for people only hate them by way of reprisal
because they are afraid of them, or else out of
vengeance because these vices have played them some
sorry turn; but a little loftiness of soul, some knowledge
of the heart, a gentle and tranquil humour, will
protect you against the risk of being either surprised,
or keenly wounded by them.'<a name="FNanchor_50_50" id="FNanchor_50_50"></a><a href="#Footnote_50_50" class="fnanchor">[50]</a></p>

<p>There is a tolerably obvious distinction between
two principal ways of examining character. One is a
musing, subjective method of delineation, in which
the various shades and windings seem to reveal themselves
with a certain spontaneity, and we follow many
recesses and depths in the heart of another, such as
only music stirs into consciousness in ourselves.
Besides this rarer poetic method, there is what may
be styled the diplomatist's method; it classifies
characters objectively, according to the kinds of outer
conduct in which they manifest themselves, and
according to the best ways of approaching and dealing
with them. The second of these describes the
spirit in which Vauvenargues observed men. He is
French, and not German, and belongs to the eighteenth
century, and not to the seventeenth or the nineteenth.<a name="Page_35" id="Page_35"></a>
His <i>Characters</i>, very little known in this country, are
as excellent as any work in this kind that we are
acquainted with, or probably as excellent as such
work can be. They are real and natural, yet while
abstaining as rigorously as Vauvenargues everywhere
does from grotesque and extravagant traits, they
avoid equally the vice of presenting the mere bald
and sterile flats of character, which he that runs may
read. As we have said, he had the quality possessed
by so few of those who write about men; he watched
men, and drew from the life. In a word, he studied
concrete examples and interrogated his own experience&mdash;the
only sure guarantee that one writing on his
themes has anything which it is worth our while to
listen to. Among other consequences of this reality
of their source is the agreeable fact that these pictures
are free from that clever bitterness and easy sarcasm,
by which crude and jejune observers, thinking more
of their own wit than of what they observe, sometimes
gain a little reputation. Even the coxcombs, self-duping
knaves, simpletons, braggarts, and other evil
or pitiful types whom he selects, are drawn with
unstrained and simple conformity to reality. The
pictures have no moral label pinned on to them. Yet
Vauvenargues took life seriously enough, and it was
just because he took it seriously, that he had no
inclination to air his wit or practise a verbal humour
upon the stuff out of which happiness and misery are
made.</p>

<p>One or two fragments will suffice. Take the Man<a name="Page_36" id="Page_36"></a>
of the World, for instance:</p>

<p>'A man of the world is not he who knows other
men best, who has most foresight or dexterity in
affairs, who is most instructed by experience and
study; he is neither a good manager, nor a man of
science, nor a politician, nor a skilful officer, nor a
painstaking magistrate. He is a man who is ignorant
of nothing but who knows nothing; who, doing his
own business ill, fancies himself very capable of doing
that of other people; a man who has much useless
wit, who has the art of saying flattering things which
do not flatter, and judicious things which give no
information; who can persuade nobody, though he
speaks well; endowed with that sort of eloquence
which can bring out trifles, and which annihilates
great subjects; as penetrating in what is ridiculous
and external in men, as he is blind to the depths of
their minds. One who, afraid of being wearisome
by reason, is wearisome by his extravagances; is
jocose without gaiety, and lively without passion.'<a name="FNanchor_51_51" id="FNanchor_51_51"></a><a href="#Footnote_51_51" class="fnanchor">[51]</a></p>

<p>Or the two following, the Inconstant Man, and
Lycas or the Firm Man:</p>

<p>'Such a man seems really to possess more than
one character. A powerful imagination makes his
soul take the shape of all the objects that affect it; he
suddenly astonishes the world by acts of generosity
and courage which were never expected of him; the
image of virtue inflames, elevates, softens, masters his
heart; he receives the impression from the loftiest,<a name="Page_37" id="Page_37"></a>
and he surpasses them. But when his imagination
has grown cold, his courage droops, his generosity
sinks; the vices opposed to these virtues take possession
of his soul, and after having reigned awhile
supreme, they make way for other objects.... We
cannot say that they have a great nature, or strong, or
weak, or light; it is a swift and imperious imagination
which reigns with sovereign power over all their
being, which subjugates their genius, and which
prescribes for them in turn those fine actions and
those faults, those heights and those littlenesses, those
flights of enthusiasm and those fits of disgust, which
we are wrong in charging either with hypocrisy or
madness.'<a name="FNanchor_52_52" id="FNanchor_52_52"></a><a href="#Footnote_52_52" class="fnanchor">[52]</a></p>

<p>'Lycas unites with a self-reliant, bold, and impetuous
nature, a spirit of reflection and profundity which
moderates the counsels of his passions, which leads
him by inpenetrable motives, and makes him advance
to his ends by many paths. He is one of those long-sighted
men, who consider the succession of events
from afar off, who always finish a design begun; who
are capable, I do not say of dissembling either a
misfortune or an offence, but of rising above either,
instead of letting it depress them; deep natures,
independent by their firmness in daring all and
suffering all; who, whether they resist their inclinations
out of foresight, or whether, out of pride and a
secret consciousness of their resources, they defy what
is called prudence, always, in good as in evil, cheat
the acutest conjectures.'<a name="FNanchor_53_53" id="FNanchor_53_53"></a><a href="#Footnote_53_53" class="fnanchor">[53]</a></p>

<p>Let us note that Vauvenargues is almost entirely<a name="Page_38" id="Page_38"></a>
free from that favourite trick of the aphoristic person,
which consists in forming a series of sentences, the
predicates being various qualifications of extravagance,
vanity, and folly, and the subject being Women. He
resists this besetting temptation of the modern speaker
of apophthegms to identify woman and fool. On the
one or two occasions in which he begins the maxim
with the fatal words, <i>Les femmes</i>, he is as little
profound as other people who persist in thinking of
man and woman as two different species. 'Women,'
for example, 'have ordinarily more vanity than
temperament, and more temperament than virtue'&mdash;which
is fairly true of all human beings, and in so far
as it is true, describes men just as exactly&mdash;and no
more so&mdash;as it describes women. In truth, Vauvenargues
felt too seriously about conduct and character
to go far in this direction. Now and again he is
content with a mere smartness, as when he says:
'There are some thoroughly excellent people who
cannot get rid of their <i>ennui</i> except at the expense of
society.' But such a mood is not common. He is
usually grave, and not seldom profoundly weighty,
delicate without being weak, and subtle without
obscurity; as for example:</p>

<p>'People teach children to fear and obey; the
avarice, pride, or timidity of the fathers, instructs the
children in economy, arrogance, or submission. We<a name="Page_39" id="Page_39"></a>
stir them up to be yet more and more copyists, which
they are only too disposed to be, as it is; nobody
thinks of making them original, hardy, independent.'</p>

<p>'If instead of dulling the vivacity of children,
people did their best to raise the impulsiveness and
movement of their characters, what might we not
expect from a fine natural temper?'</p>

<p>Again: 'The moderation of the weak is mediocrity.'</p>

<p>'What is arrogance in the weak is elevation in the
strong; as the strength of a sick man is frenzy, and
that of a whole man is vigour.'</p>

<p>'To speak imprudently and to speak boldly are
nearly always the same thing. But we may speak
without prudence, and still speak what is right; and
it is a mistake to fancy that a man has a shallow
intelligence, because the boldness of his character or
the liveliness of his temper may have drawn from
him, in spite of himself, some dangerous truth.'</p>

<p>'It is a great sign of mediocrity always to praise
moderately.'</p>

<hr style='width: 45%;' />

<p>Vauvenargues has a saying to the effect that men
very often, without thinking of it, form an idea of
their face and expression from the ruling sentiment
of which they are conscious in themselves at the time.
He hints that this is perhaps the reason why a coxcomb
always believes himself to be handsome.<a name="FNanchor_54_54" id="FNanchor_54_54"></a><a href="#Footnote_54_54" class="fnanchor">[54]</a> And
in a letter to Mirabeau, he describes pleasantly how
sometimes in moments of distraction he pictures himself<a name="Page_40" id="Page_40"></a>
with an air of loftiness, of majesty, of penetration,
according to the idea that is occupying his mind, and
how if by chance he sees his face in the mirror, he is
nearly as much amazed as if he saw a Cyclops or a
Tartar.<a name="FNanchor_55_55" id="FNanchor_55_55"></a><a href="#Footnote_55_55" class="fnanchor">[55]</a> Yet his nature, if we may trust the portrait,
revealed itself in his face; it is one of the most
delightful to look upon, even in the cold inarticulateness
of an engraving, that the gallery of fair souls
contains for us. We may read the beauty of his
character in the soft strength of the brow, the meditative
lines of mouth and chin, above all, the striking
clearness, the self-collection, the feminine solicitude,
that mingle freely and without eagerness or expectancy
in his gaze, as though he were hearkening to some ever-flowing
inward stream of divine melody. We think of
that gracious touch in Bacon's picture of the father of
Solomon's House, that 'he had an aspect as though he
pitied men.' If we reproach France in the eighteenth
century with its coarseness, artificiality, shallowness,
because it produced such men as the rather brutish
Duclos, we ought to remember that this was also the
century of Vauvenargues, one of the most tender,
lofty, cheerful, and delicately sober of all moralists.</p>

Updated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions
will be renamed.

Creating the works from public domain print editions means that no
one owns a United States copyright in these works, so the Foundation
(and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United States without
permission and without paying copyright royalties.  Special rules,
set forth in the General Terms of Use part of this license, apply to
copying and distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works to
protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm concept and trademark.  Project
Gutenberg is a registered trademark, and may not be used if you
charge for the eBooks, unless you receive specific permission.  If you
do not charge anything for copies of this eBook, complying with the
rules is very easy.  You may use this eBook for nearly any purpose
such as creation of derivative works, reports, performances and
research.  They may be modified and printed and given away--you may do
practically ANYTHING with public domain eBooks.  Redistribution is
subject to the trademark license, especially commercial
redistribution.



*** START: FULL LICENSE ***

THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE
PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK

To protect the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full Project
Gutenberg-tm License (available with this file or online at
http://gutenberg.net/license).


Section 1.  General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works

1.A.  By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement.  If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or destroy
all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your possession.
If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound by the
terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person or
entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.

1.B.  "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark.  It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement.  There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement.  See
paragraph 1.C below.  There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this agreement
and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.  See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C.  The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the Foundation"
or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection of Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works.  Nearly all the individual works in the
collection are in the public domain in the United States.  If an
individual work is in the public domain in the United States and you are
located in the United States, we do not claim a right to prevent you from
copying, distributing, performing, displaying or creating derivative
works based on the work as long as all references to Project Gutenberg
are removed.  Of course, we hope that you will support the Project
Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting free access to electronic works by
freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm works in compliance with the terms of
this agreement for keeping the Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with
the work.  You can easily comply with the terms of this agreement by
keeping this work in the same format with its attached full Project
Gutenberg-tm License when you share it without charge with others.

1.D.  The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work.  Copyright laws in most countries are in
a constant state of change.  If you are outside the United States, check
the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this agreement
before downloading, copying, displaying, performing, distributing or
creating derivative works based on this work or any other Project
Gutenberg-tm work.  The Foundation makes no representations concerning
the copyright status of any work in any country outside the United
States.

1.E.  Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1.  The following sentence, with active links to, or other immediate
access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear prominently
whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work on which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed, performed, viewed,
copied or distributed:

This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere at no cost and with
almost no restrictions whatsoever.  You may copy it, give it away or
re-use it under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included
with this eBook or online at www.gutenberg.net

1.E.2.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is derived
from the public domain (does not contain a notice indicating that it is
posted with permission of the copyright holder), the work can be copied
and distributed to anyone in the United States without paying any fees
or charges.  If you are redistributing or providing access to a work
with the phrase "Project Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the
work, you must comply either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1
through 1.E.7 or obtain permission for the use of the work and the
Project Gutenberg-tm trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or
1.E.9.

1.E.3.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any additional
terms imposed by the copyright holder.  Additional terms will be linked
to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works posted with the
permission of the copyright holder found at the beginning of this work.

1.E.4.  Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

1.E.5.  Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6.  You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including any
word processing or hypertext form.  However, if you provide access to or
distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format other than
"Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official version
posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site (www.gutenberg.net),
you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense to the user, provide a
copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means of obtaining a copy upon
request, of the work in its original "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other
form.  Any alternate format must include the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

1.E.7.  Do not charge a fee for access to, viewing, displaying,
performing, copying or distributing any Project Gutenberg-tm works
unless you comply with paragraph 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.8.  You may charge a reasonable fee for copies of or providing
access to or distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works provided
that

- You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
     the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
     you already use to calculate your applicable taxes.  The fee is
     owed to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he
     has agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the
     Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation.  Royalty payments
     must be paid within 60 days following each date on which you
     prepare (or are legally required to prepare) your periodic tax
     returns.  Royalty payments should be clearly marked as such and
     sent to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the
     address specified in Section 4, "Information about donations to
     the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation."

- You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
     you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
     does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
     License.  You must require such a user to return or
     destroy all copies of the works possessed in a physical medium
     and discontinue all use of and all access to other copies of
     Project Gutenberg-tm works.

- You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of any
     money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
     electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days
     of receipt of the work.

- You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
     distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9.  If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work or group of works on different terms than are set
forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing from
both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and Michael
Hart, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark.  Contact the
Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH F3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3.  LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS' WITH NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO
WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTIBILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5.  Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

1.F.6.  INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,
promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works,
harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.
To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
and how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4
and the Foundation web page at http://www.pglaf.org.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including including checks, online payments and credit card
donations.  To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.net

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
